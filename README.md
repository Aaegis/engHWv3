A project to help students with Mr. Madden's English homework and for the CPT.

This project is made to help students memorize word definitions for Mr. Madden's English vocabulary tests, as well any vocabulary on final(s). It was also created for the Create Performance Task for MS. Cabral's AP Computer Science Principles class.

I created this project because I wanted to learn web development, have a project for the CPT, but most importantly, help my classmates with their homework. Some time in January of 2023, I was shocked to hear that a large portion of the class would get Cs or lower, and I think I might be able to help them. With this website, the student is intended to use it to generate a list of the words they need to memorize in a random order. From there, they can copy
the outputted text into a text editor (such as Google Docs, Notepad, Notepad++, etc.) and see if they can write down
their definitions without having to look it up. Eventually, they would have memorized the words, and should hopefully
pass any test or final.

Without this website: The student either must try to memorize a word's definition, either by writing down the words'
definitions, or manually shuffling it themselves. Manually shuffling it themselves is time consuming, and in my
personal experience, isn't worth it.

With this website: The student is able to shuffle the words with a single press of a button, making studying/memorization easier, and improving grades.



As of 3/20/23, this is the newest version of the "English HW Helper"/"English Homework Helper"/"engHW", or any other similar name you might prefer to call it by.

This project was made by Kenneth Vu, a freshman attending Gunderson High School. I would prefer to go by Kenny.

I have also made earlier versions of English HW Helper. They can be seen at

V1: https://github.com/Aaegis/English-Vocab-Lesson-Helper

V2: https://github.com/Aaegis/vocabHelperV2

Note for V1: I had help from another student with design. However, V1 has been deprecated and replaced by V2, which will now be replaced by V3 (this version).

Code from earlier versions of English HW Helper may be used in order to develop this project, as well as code from below:

The IDE I used to make this was Visual Studio Code (VSCode). My project also relies on a CDN in order to use Bootstrap 5. Bootstrap 5 was not developed by me, and was made by a third party.
