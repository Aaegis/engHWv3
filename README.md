# engHWv3
A project to help students with Mr. Madden's English homework and for the CPT

This project is made to help students memorize words for Mr. Madden's English vocabulary tests, as well any vocabulary on final(s). It was also created for the Create Performance Task for MS. Cabral's AP Computer Science Principles class.

As of 3/20/23, this is the newest version of the "English HW Helper"/"English Homework Helper"/"engHW", or any other similar name you might prefer to call it by.

This project was made by Kenneth Vu, a freshman attending Gunderson High School. I would prefer to go by Kenny.

I have also made earlier versions of English HW Helper. They can be seen at
V1: https://github.com/Aaegis/English-Vocab-Lesson-Helper
V2: https://github.com/Aaegis/vocabHelperV2

Note for V1: I had help from another student with design. However, V1 has been deprecated and replaced by V2, which will now be replaced by V3 (this version). 

Code from earlier versions of English HW Helper may be used in order to develop this project, as well as code from below:

The IDE I used to make this was Visual Studio Code (VSCode). My project also relies on a CDN in order to use Bootstrap 5. Bootstrap 5 was not developed by me, and was made by a third party.
